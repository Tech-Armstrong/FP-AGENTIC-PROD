"""
Resource Allocation Strategy - Goals & Loans

What this file does:
This script implements sophisticated allocation strategies for funding goals and loan prepayments.
It optimizes resource utilization through greedy allocation, prepayment analysis, and multi-scenario optimization.

What this file contains and processes:
- plan_goals: Allocates liquid pool, monthly surplus, and freed SIPs to fund goals using greedy strategy with optional postponement up to max_postpone years
- plan_prepayments: Strategizes loan prepayment by splitting monthly surplus and lump sum evenly across eligible loans, capping allocations to avoid over-payment
- choose_optimal_strategy: Selects optimal allocation strategy across multiple scenarios by maximizing combined score of surplus ratio and interest savings
